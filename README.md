# LibScrib - Project 2 Group 4

What Our Application Does:<br> 

Our application is designed to allow users to search for information about a desired book. This application grants the user unfettered access to the New York Times Bestseller database.
When the user enters in the title of a book, the application searches through the NYTBS Database and finds all pertinent information about the book. Users can read the book's synopsis, 
peruse the reviews and even leave a review for the book themselves.

What Technologies We Used:<br>

MySQL - Database
Bcrypt - Password-Hashing
Bootcamp - Design
dotenv - Secutriy
Express - Middleware
Express-session - Create and manage a session Middleware
express-handlebars - Templating Engine
nodemon - Node.js development tool
sequelize - Node.js Object Relational Mapper


Challenges:<br> 

Famliarize with handlebars
Rendering data and connecting between the front end and backend
Getting frontend to work sequelize
